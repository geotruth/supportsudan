### Who We Are

Hi, we're **geo:truth**,  a nonprofit research organization using the power of geography and data to uncover and address critical global challenges. We are committed to tackling health disparities, economic inequities, and the impacts of crises like the war in Sudan through geospatial analysis and innovative research methods.  

Our goal is to create a world where everyone‚Äîno matter their location‚Äîhas equal access to health, well-being, and opportunity. We collaborate with local organizations, healthcare providers, and community leaders to provide the data and tools they need to make informed decisions and create lasting change.

### Why Support the Sudan & Diaspora-Owned Businesses and Projects Dashboard?

In response to the ongoing crisis in Sudan, which has displaced **millions** of people and left over **50%** of the population without jobs, geo:truth has launched a dashboard to promote Sudanese- and diaspora-owned businesses. By supporting these businesses, you help sustain livelihoods in a time of great need.

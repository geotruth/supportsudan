                                <p>The war in Sudan has affected millions of people. Over <b>25 million</b> Sudanese have been forced to leave their homes because of the fighting, and many have lost their jobs and businesses. In fact, about <b>50%</b> of people living in Sudan have lost their jobs due to the conflict, making it even harder for families to survive and rebuild.</p>
                                <p>This dashboard is in place to help Sudanese-owned businesses and projects, both in Sudan and around the world (the diaspora).

By supporting these businesses, you‚Äôre helping people recover from the war, get back to work, and rebuild their communities.\n\n\nHow You Can Help:\n\nFind Businesses: Explore the list of Sudanese and diaspora-owned businesses, and see if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to support or purchase.\nSpread the Word: Share this website with your friends and family to help these businesses grow and reach more people.\nAdd a Business: Know of a Sudanese or diaspora-owned business?
